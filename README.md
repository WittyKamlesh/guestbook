# an_online _guest_book
 It is guest book registration. On this site, we can register admin users as of now. In the future, admin roles will be assigned for better module management. You can visit admin with 'server-location'/guestbook/admin.  The search feature is implemented in a guest table. Exporting data with various formats like CSV, excel, pdf extensions is possible. But the pdf layout has a little bug. Dates are implemented in such a way that as you can't select past dates.
